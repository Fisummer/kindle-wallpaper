====================================

Author: Pablo Jim√©nez Mateo

Do you use a Kindle and hope that the wallpapers could be more useful? Well, that has just changed,
with this program you will display the weather and some task to do retrieved from Yahoo Weather
and Google calendar!

You can see a preview in the preview.png file

Based on the idea of Matthew Petroff: http://www.mpetroff.net/archives/2012/09/14/kindle-weather-display/
